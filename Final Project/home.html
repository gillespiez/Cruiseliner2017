                    Octopus cruises was established in 1994 by Ted Mosby. Situated in Durban, South Africa, Octopus cruises has a wide range of cruises that customers can choose from at reasonable prices. It has grown a lot over the last 23 years and hopes to become one of the leading cruise liners in the world. At Octopus cruises we aim to help our customers create unforgetable memories.

                   <b>Are the cruises child friendly?</b>
                <br/>
                Octopus Cruises has a family-friendly cruise ship that allows families with young children to enjoy a cruise. We also give parents the option of taking their children to the 24 hour onboard daycare centre.

                <b>Can I be contacted when I am at sea?</b>
                <br/>
                All ships in the Octopus Cruises fleet have a Satellite telephone on board. This service is VERY expensive and should be used for emergencies only.
                
                <p>
                <b>Is there a Doctor on board?</b>
                <br/>
                The ship has a medical facility staffed by a Doctor and nursing personnel. This is a private service and all consultations are charged for. Please note that the medical facility does not operate as a pharmacy and a consultation with the Doctor is required prior to any medicine being dispensed. We highly recommend that you take all necessary medications onboard with you. Please note the mandatory cruise insurance included in your cruise fare does not cover this Doctor. Please also be advised to check with your Medical Aid Scheme prior to departure whether they will reimburse you for any visits to the Doctor on board realising that the Doctor is not a South African Doctor and does not have a practice number, and that you will be within International waters at the time of visiting the onboard Doctor.
